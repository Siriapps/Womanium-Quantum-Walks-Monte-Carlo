# Womanium-Quantum-Walks-Monte-Carlo
Womanium project 1
Challenge deliverables
1. Review the paper, and any related resources to learn how to implement quantum Galton boards. Prepare a summary of your understanding in a well structured 2-pager document. 
2. Using the 1- and 2-layer Galton Box code as a starting point, write a general algorithm that generates a circuit for any number of layers. Run and verify that the output is a Gaussian distribution. You may use any quantum SDK and platform for your implementation.
3. Modify the function so that it obtains a different target distribution. Use a noiseless all-to-all sampler:
   * Exponential distribution
   * Hadamard quantum walk
4. Using a noise model of real hardware, come up with an optimized implementation of this problem for the previous distributions. The challenge is to maximize the accuracy and number of board layers. You may use any quantum hardware noise model for your simulations
5. Compute the distances between the obtained distributions and the target distributions, accounting for stochastic uncertainty.

Judging Criteria
1. The submissions must be in an easy-to-access, and well-structured format.
2. All participants must complete Tasks 1), 2) and 3) to be eligible for project certificates. 
3. The best accuracy and attempt at Tasks 4) and 5) would be given the most weight. Finalists for QSL fellowships will be decided on the basis of highest cumulative scores from all the tasks, Technical Merit, Novelty, Communication and Presentation Skills.
